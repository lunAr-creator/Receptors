## About The Project

<!-- <img src="sample.png" width="600"> -->

Receptors is a command line program for making the process of checking the status, response time and other various info about a URL, easier.

Here's why:

* Your time should be valued, and checking URL's manually is not something that will benefit you. 
* Receptors aims to correct this by providing a simple and easy to use command line program which will do it for you, requiring little to no input and writing results to a file!

## Built With

* Requests
* Argparse
